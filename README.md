#File splitter and joiner

##Introduction
The idea of this splitter and joiner case because I had to move a few large
files from one computer to another via a shared folder that has much less free
space than the size of the files that I want to transfer.

This application takes the large file and creates multiple smaller files of the
size you specify.

##Usage
>> split [-j | -s -sz <filesize (mb|gb|kb)> source destination
